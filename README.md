# chromeExtension => override the new tab
MATURED functionalities:
* block youtube feed, you can still see them after you finish watching your videos

TODO list:
* Display most recently added bookmarks, as google default bookmarks does not have a sort, and without openning the bookmark manager...you need to navigate till the bottom of the list...this takes a while for a person like me who likes to bookmark pages and sometime never come back to it
* Display where you spend most of your time online (for now it shows how many visit to each root url you entered)
* ~~When loading your history, add animation (reording and incrementing, number changing etc)~~
* Daily quotes (external APIs)
* Dict.youdao.com get your most recently vocabulary list (from the url)
* Google.com get your keywords (from the url)
* May not apply here, but when you have multiple tabs open, organize them as groups with the same root url?
* double click to rename the bookmark, red X mark to delete
* ~~Add tiles that filter by tag ie [antares] or filter by folder~~
* for work, you can trigger cmd and providing arguments
* ~~hover to show actual url in the new tab~~
* ~~display fav icon~~
* make the list draggable
* weekly use static history, daily use animation

DEBUG list:
* Sometimes, the most common websites won't even show up
