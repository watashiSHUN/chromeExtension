# chromeExtension => override the new tab
TODO list:
1. display most recently added bookmarks, as google default bookmarks does not have a sort, and without openning the bookmark manager...you need to navigate till the bottom of the list...this takes a while for a person like me who likes to bookmark pages and sometime never come back to it
2. display where you spend most of your time online (for now it shows how many visit to each root url you entered)
3. daily quotes (external APIs)
4. dict.youdao.com get your most recently vocabulary list (from the url)
5. google.com get your keywords (from the url)
6. maynot apply here, but when you have multiple tabs open, organize them as groups with the same root url?
