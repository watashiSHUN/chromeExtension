# chromeExtension => override the new tab
TODO list:
* Display most recently added bookmarks, as google default bookmarks does not have a sort, and without openning the bookmark manager...you need to navigate till the bottom of the list...this takes a while for a person like me who likes to bookmark pages and sometime never come back to it
* Display where you spend most of your time online (for now it shows how many visit to each root url you entered)
* When loading your history, add animation (reording and incrementing, number changing etc)
* Daily quotes (external APIs)
* Dict.youdao.com get your most recently vocabulary list (from the url)
* Google.com get your keywords (from the url)
* Maynot apply here, but when you have multiple tabs open, organize them as groups with the same root url?
* Add "edit" for bookmarks => rename/delete
* Remove pakage.json, can't run it locally anyway
* Add tiles that filter by tag ie [antares] or filter by folder
* for work, you can trigger cmd and providing arguments
* add a event listener for history change
* hover to show actual url in the new tab
* ~~display fav icon~~
* make the list draggable

DEBUG list:
* Sometimes, the most common websites won't even show up
